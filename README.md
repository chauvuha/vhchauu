### Hi there, I am Vu Ha Chau 👋



🌱  As a programmer, I learn to use pixels to display colors and create magic in my websites. 

🦄  You can also find me and a more “visual” introduction of myself at https://vuhachau.com/. Here, I re-create my porfolio under the concept "Pixfolio" (Pixels + Portfolio), where present my projects, extracurricular activities, and my home in Hanoi city - what makes me who I am, all in ✨ Pixels ✨!

📫  Feel free to reach me if you have any questions: vuhachau2412@gmail.com
